# What is DXL4L?

DXL4L is Library for Gaming Library.It is an acronym for DXLib for Lite/Linux/sdL.

The original DXLib is made by Takumi Yamada. this is very useful. But,this is able to use only Windows. I want to play my Game by making DxLib on Linux(e.g.Ubuntu). 

So, I'll make similar Library. But, No implement a 3D features.No implement an advanced 2D features. I'll only implement the minimum features.(Probably, It isn't practical for most people. )

Ah...One of my goals is that master how to use SDL.
